Adding to an already triumphant career, Childers released his acclaimed new album, Rustin’ In The Rain, late last year via Hickman Holler Records/RCA Records, which includes the GRAMMY and ACM-nominated single, “In Your Love.”

“In Your Love” has garnered over 10 million video views to date, 180 million on-demand streams and received praise from outlets such as NPR Music, Billboard, Pitchfork, Stereogum, The Advocate and Rolling Stone, who declared it “the music video of compassion and caring we need right now,” while USA Today called the video “a much-needed portrait of inclusivity.” View here.

Since his 2017 breakthrough long player “Purgatory,” Childers has released three additional albums and performed countless sold-out shows across the world. Known for his electric live concerts, the Kentucky native kicked off his extensive US “Mule Pull ‘24 Tour” with sold-out shows at Inglewood’s Kia Forum, Austin’s Moody Center, two nights at New York’s Madison Square Garden and two nights at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena, of which The Tennessean praised, “a powerfully emotional performance…[Childers] emerged in Nashville as a confident arena superstar.”"

Between enduring fan-revered singles like Duality, Psychosocial and Wait and Bleed, as well as deeper cuts and newer material over the years, SLIPKNOT’s drive and creativity bleeds through their jaw-dropping live performances. 

In 2012, the journey to creating a platform of their own in KNOTFEST, was born out of SLIPKNOT’s dedication to creating a memorable live experience for audiences around the world. Headline slots at some of the world’s biggest festivals including Download, Wacken, Rock In Rio, Louder Than Life, Hellfest and more perfectly set SLIPKNOT up with the ambition to take things further; building their own festival that not only championed new waves of incredible talent, but enshrined their own status as one of the best bands to do it.”

Their story begins with Devolve (1990), a high-octane four-track EP of Metallica-inspired thrash. A year later bassist Karl Kippenberger joined Tom Larkin (Drums), Phil Knight (Lead guitar) and Jon Toogood (Vocals and guitars) to solidify the line-up that would change the face of New Zealand music and earn the enviable reputation as Aotearoa’s most formidable live band.

The group broke through with its second album Killjoy (1995), which blended the colossally heavy riffs of debut album Churn (1991), with a newfound pop sensibility. This potent mix would become the signature SHIHAD sound.

Killjoy spawned two Top 20 singles, ‘You Again’ and ‘Bitter’, and won four Aotearoa Music Awards (AMA’s), to begin a winning streak that would see SHIHAD collect 18 AMA’s throughout their career and be inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame in 2010.

Nine of SHIHAD’s 10 studio albums powered into the New Zealand Music Charts Top 10, with six (The General Electric (1999), Beautiful Machine (2008), Ignite (2010), FVEY (2014) and Old Gods (2021)) hitting the top spot, a feat unrivalled by any other local act.

Powering those albums are iconic songs, like ‘Run’, ‘The General Electric’, ‘La La Land’, ‘Pacifier’, ‘My Mind’s Sedate’, and instant classic ‘Home Again’, a signature anthem not just for SHIHAD, but for all Kiwis abroad.

Along with these soaring highs, SHIHAD experienced heavy lows. But no setback could withstand the crushing power, purpose and propulsive momentum of the band.

Live, SHIHAD were truly an oversized presence. 2005’s free gig at Auckland’s Aotea Square is legendary, they owned the prized sunset spot at music festival Big Day Out for years, headlined major festivals like Rhythm and Alps and toured with metal icons like Faith No More, Black Sabbath, Motorhead and AC/DC.

But with gaps between albums increasing, growing commitments outside the band and the member's inability to give SHIHAD the time, focus and dedication it needed and deserved, the group made the hard call to conclude the band. While opinions within differ, the group are united in agreeing that half-assing SHIHAD was never an option.

But SHIHAD’s story is not over just yet. The upcoming LOUD FOREVER tour offers both the band and its nation of fans the opportunity of a fittingly loud and raucous farewell."

Fast forward to 2018, Drake dropped the platinum double LP, Scorpion which included a staggering 25 tracks.

Kehlani will open your eyes, open your mind, and open your heart. For as blunt as she may be about life, longing, lust, and love, her music occupies an elevated state above even the best high—yet accessible by simply listening. The Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multi-platinum songstress unlocks this place anytime she picks up a pen or grabs a microphone. Since 2014, her light has only continued to glow brighter. Thus far, she’s picked up over twenty Gold and Platinum RIAA certifications, tallied 9 billion streams, and garnered a pair of GRAMMY® Award nominations in the categories of “Best Urban Contemporary Album'' for the gold-certified mixtape You Should Be Here and “Best R&B Performance” for the platinum single “Distraction.”

Beyond blockbuster collaborations with Cardi B, Justin Bieber, Post Malone, Burna Boy, Young Boy Never Broke Again, Calvin Harris, she has appeared on soundtracks such as Suicide Squad: The Album, The Fate of the Furious: The Album, and more. Along the way, she’s received the “Rule Breaker Award'' from Billboard Women In Music and performed at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond.

She welcomed everyone into the rapture of her third full-length album, blue water road (Atlantic Records) in 2022. After she concluded a sold-out run through North America, featuring support from Rico Nasty and Destin Conrad, she brought her acclaimed The Blue Water Road Trip to a close in Australia/Asia. Earlier this year, Kehlani made a triumphant return with her acclaimed fourth studio album, CRASH, featuring the smash hit “After Hours.” Kehlani describes her new album as her “most free, most fun, most loud, and most fueled” project thus far and plans to keep the party going on her forthcoming global arena tour, CRASH WORLD TOUR.

Since emerging as a dynamic breath of fresh air in New Zealand’s music scene, JESSB has taken that early momentum & has created it into a proper whirlwind. Mixing afro-inspired diasporic sounds, both high energy & introspective, JESSB is becoming a force to be reckoned with both at home and around the globe. She has collaborated with the likes of Saweetie, Doja Cat, Sister Nancy, Sampa The Great, Kranium, G Flip and Baker Boy."

The wait is finally over. DAY6 (데이식스) are coming to New Zealand for the first time ever this April on their 3RD WORLD TOUR <FOREVER YOUNG>.

DAY6 is a South Korean pop-rock band under JYP Entertainment. The group debuted on September 7, 2015, with their EP <The Day>, which peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s World Album Chart just a week after its release. The band consists of four members: SUNGJIN, Young K, WONPIL, and DOWOON. Unlike typical bands, three members of DAY6 contribute as both instrumentalists and vocalists.

DAY6’s music spans a wide spectrum and is not confined to any single genre. Their sound seamlessly blends elements of pop, rock, hip-hop, and more, all while maintaining the unique identity that sets DAY6 apart. Known as the “trustworthy band” for their consistent delivery of quality music, every album they release receives widespread acclaim from both the public and critics. In 2024, DAY6 made a highly anticipated comeback with their album <Fourever> after all the members completed their military service, bringing a refreshing and energetic sound that continues to resonate deeply within the evolving landscape of the Korean music scene."
